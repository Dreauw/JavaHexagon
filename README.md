#Java Hexagon
Java Hexagon is a very basic clone of [Super Hexagon](http://superhexagon.com/) by Terry Cavanagh.
It's written in Java (using Swing/Java2D)

##Aim
I was interested in how this game was programmed. So I've tried to replicate with a really simple way of doing it, and it worked out pretty well.


##Features
- The game is fully configurable by editing the model/Constants.java file.
- There's an IA but it's really basic and will easily lose.
- The obstacles are generated randomly, there's no pattern (but it can be done easily)
- The model is independent from the view, so it's a sort of MVC
